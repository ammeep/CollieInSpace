This game was used in workshops designed to get kids interested in programming. This game is built in JavaScript, too make it as simple as possible for you to run the game at home, and view the source code. All you need is a browser.\r\n\r\nChances are, if you have come to this repo then you attended a workshop on programming, where you built or took part in building the first level of Collie In Space. And now you are here to find out more! Congratulations, you have taken the first steps to learning more about becomming a programmer.\r\n\r\nOn this site you can play the game, but there are also links to the source. Over time I hope to add more and more comments to the source, to make it similier to follow.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"UA-38721901-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
