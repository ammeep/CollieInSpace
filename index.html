        <h3>Welcome to Collie In Space</h3>

<p>A sample game built with <a href="http://jindo.dev.naver.com/collie/">Collie.js</a>. This game was used in workshops designed to get kids interested in programming. This game is built in JavaScript, too make it as simple as possible for you to run the game at home, and view the source code. All you need is a browser.</p>

<p>Chances are, if you have come to this repo then you attended a workshop on programming, where you built or took part in building the first level of Collie In Space. And now you are here to find out more! Congratulations, you have taken the first steps to learning more about becoming a programmer.</p>

<p>On this site you can play the game, but there are also links to the source. Over time I hope to add more and more comments to the source, to make it similar to follow.</p>
